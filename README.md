## Description
The main goal of our project is to detect strange behavior using a camera. The strange behaviour is determined by situation in which chosen objects go out of the borders or disappear from the camera view. Also our system can find some objects without selecting (the list of objects is presented [FILE_NAME]).
	
## Getting Started:
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them



## Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running




End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Usage:

To start/stop a video press 'Play'.

To add new object to list of tracking items, 

Firstly, select boundaries for object.
